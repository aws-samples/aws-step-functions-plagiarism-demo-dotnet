## AWS Step Functions Plagiarism Demo .NET

Welcome! This a simple workflow to demonstrate how you can combine [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [AWS XRay](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/), using [Microsoft .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

Along the way we provide an example of how to integrate [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway/) with AWS Step Functions, and use the [AWS Step Function Service Integration Callback Pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html), to interface with an external website from a manual process in the workflow.

You will also see how we use the [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) to define and model your Serverless application, and use [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli) to build and deploy it.

### The Scenario

To illustrate the use of [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) I have created a scenario that describes a process where university students caught plagiarising on exams and/or assignments are required to take a test to assess their knowledge of the universities referencing standards.

Visually, the process looks like this:

![Developing With Step Functions](media/step_22_07_24.png "Developing With Step Functions")

The process starts by:

1. Registering the plagiarism incident
1. Scheduling an exam. Students have one week to complete the test.
1. Send the student an email notification to inform them of the requirement
1. The process waits for the student to complete the exam, then
1. Determining whether or not the student has sat the exam, or passed

> If the student has fails the exam they are allowed to resit the exam. Students get 3 attempts to pass the exam before the incident is either resolved, or administrative action is taken.

### The Architecture

![Developing With Step Functions Architecture](media/arch_22_07_24.png "Developing With Step Functions Architecture")

The architecture is relatively simple. There are two front end websites - one "Admin" website that capture the plagiarism incident; and a "Testing Centre" that tests the students knowledge of plagiarism.

The incident captured at via the Admin website initiates the AWS Step Function execution through an AWS Service integration on the `/incident` resource for the `POST` method.

![Integration Request](media/api-step.png "Integration Request")

Once the the exam is scheduled, we use an Amazon SNS Integration Task with a `.waitForTaskToken` (see [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token)). The Task Token is passed to the function (using built in reference of `$$.Task.Token`) which in turn generates the email notifying the student of the exam requirements.

The result of the exam passeHere is a sample from the state machine:

``` yaml
  Notify student:
    Type: Task
    Resource: 'arn:aws:states:::sns:publish.waitForTaskToken'
    Parameters:
        TopicArn: '${NotificationTopic}'
        Message.$: "States.Format('\"IncidentId\": \"{}\", \"ExamId\": \"{}\", \"Score\": 0 , \"TaskToken\": 
                    \"{}\"', $.Payload.IncidentId, $.Payload.Exams[0].ExamId, $$.Task.Token)"
    Next: HasStudentPassedExam
```

Once the student receives the email, the Task Token is passed to the Testing Centre. The student answers the questions and submits the results to the `/exam` resource on the API. The Lambda integration processes the TaskToken and passes the results of the waiting execution to continue the workflow execution.

Tip: Use the payload in the email that is sent to you to simulate the response. Make sure you modify the score before sending it to the Plagiarism API.
